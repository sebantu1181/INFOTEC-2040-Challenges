# INFOTEC-2040-Challenges
This course presents programming principles and their syntactical representation and implementation across languages including those that are compiled and interpreted. The course shows how to implement algorithms and data structures to solve problems while utilizing paradigms offered by the programming languages such as procedural, object-oriented, protocol-oriented, functional, and declarative. Language support for strong and weak typing and type safety are covered along with support for optional values. This course provides experience in developing algorithms and determining their efficiency, designing application architecture, and developing applications. Building and using libraries/application programming interfaces is covered. Git and GitHub are used for code versioning and collaboration. Integrated development environments (IDEs) are used for managing, building, debugging, and testing applications.
