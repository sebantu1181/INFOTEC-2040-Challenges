Write a FizzBuzz program in the programming language of your choice.

"""The FizzBuzz program is to output numbers from 1 to 100. 
If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with “Fizz”. 
If it is divisible by 5, replace it with “Buzz”. 
If it is divisible by 3 and 5 replace it with “FizzBuzz”."""




for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
